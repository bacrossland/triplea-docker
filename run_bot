# This is a script for running a TripleA bot on a Unix-like system.
#
# To run this script, change to the directory in which you unpacked the
# headless game server archive, and type "./run_bot" and specifies options.
# Full usage details are found under --help, "./run_bot -h".

#
# The TripleA username that owns the bot.
#
# This is a required variable. The default is empty string which will be replaced
# with the value passed into the script. The script will not run without a username.
#
USER=

#
# The folder from which the bot will load game maps.
#
# The default value is the folder in which the TripleA game client stores
# maps that it downloads.  Under normal circumstances, you will not have to
# change this variable.  However, if you customized the settings in your
# TripleA client to use a different maps folder, you should change this
# variable to refer to the same location.
#
# DO NOT CHANGE!!!
# This is set to the location of the software install.
#
MAPS_FOLDER="/opt/triplea/downloadedMaps"

#
# The port on which the bot will listen for connections.  This port must be
# reachable from the Internet, so you may have to configure your firewall
# appropriately.
#
# Under normal circumstances, you will not have to change this variable.
# However, if you choose to run multiple bots on your system, you need to
# select a different available port for each bot.
#
BOT_PORT=3300

#
# The name of the bot as displayed in the lobby.  Each bot must have a unique
# name.
#
# The default value uses a combination of your username and the local port
# you selected above on which the bot will run.  Under normal circumstances,
# you will not have to change this variable.
#
# Here the value is set to blank and later set to the default if an override is not
# provided through start options.
#
BOT_NAME=

#
# The hostname of the lobby to which the bot will connect.
#
# The default value is the hostname for the TripleA community's public lobby.
# Under normal circumstances, you will not have to change this variable.
#
LOBBY_URI="https://prod2-lobby.triplea-game.org"
